## Assistant Logic Overview

The assistant follows a structured survival plan:

### Step 1: Situation Assessment
- Asks what kind of emergency the user is in
- Distinguishes between urban accidents (calls emergency numbers) and remote survival scenarios

### Step 2: Data Collection
- User's mental and physical condition
- Available items, health, injuries, fears, and allergies
- Environment details (hazards, water, food, shelter)

### Step 3: Survival Action Plan
- Applies psychological support (e.g. jokes, quotes, check-ins)
- Provides first-aid advice based on symptoms
- Suggests meals with local ingredients and minerals
- Offers survival use cases for nearby items
- Guides on fire-building, shelter, navigation, etc.

### Step 4: Status Tracking
- Users can input `STATUS` to update:
  - Hunger (1‚Äì10)
  - Thirst (1‚Äì10)
  - Fatigue (1‚Äì10)
  - Injuries and available items
- Automatically reduces these stats every 2.5 hours

### Step 5: Continuous Motivation
- Encourages exploration for shelter/items
- Uses device tools if available
- Reminds user of skills and techniques
